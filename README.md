Sijoitustutkimus Coding Task

This is very open topic and the goal is to measure how professionally you implement it. Have fun!

Implement a weather monitoring service based on listed requirements. Programming language, runtime environment and packages are free for you to choose as long as we execute the app.

Requirements:

·         Application is long lived - once launched is should keep monitoring weather data until user terminates it.

·         User can configure one or more locations to poll for temperature and the polling interval for each location.

·         User can also configure alerts for per location by specifying target low and high (or both!)

·         Configuration should be done by uend user, in other words not inside program code.

·         Application should user Dark Sky API to obtain weather data https:/darksky.net/dev
